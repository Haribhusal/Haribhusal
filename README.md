👋 Hello there! I'm Hari Bhusal, a passionate MERN Stack developer with a strong emphasis on building scalable and efficient web applications using Next.js. With a blend of frontend and backend expertise, I thrive on crafting seamless user experiences and robust backend infrastructures.

🚀 What I Do:
Frontend Development: Leveraging the power of Next.js, I create performant, SEO-friendly, and responsive web applications. I focus on implementing best practices in React, ensuring state management is streamlined and UI components are reusable.

Backend Development: Proficient in Node.js and Express, I design RESTful APIs and integrate them with MongoDB to deliver data-driven solutions. My backend architectures are scalable, secure, and optimized for high performance.

Full-Stack Mastery: With expertise across the entire MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Next.js, and Node.js), I ensure that both frontend and backend components of my applications work harmoniously to deliver exceptional user experiences.

DevOps & Deployment: Experienced in deploying Next.js applications on platforms like Vercel, Netlify, and AWS. I prioritize continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) practices, ensuring that my applications are always up-to-date and highly available.

🛠️ Tech Stack:
Frontend: React, Next.js, TypeScript, HTML/CSS, SASS/SCSS
Backend: Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, RESTful APIs
DevOps: Docker, AWS, Vercel, Netlify
Tools & Others: Figma, Adobe Photoshop, Git, GitHub Actions, Postman, Jest, Mocha, Chai

🌱 What I'm Currently Learning:
